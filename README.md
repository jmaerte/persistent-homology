# Persistent Homology of Metric Point Cloud Data
Persistent homology is a mighty tool when it comes to recognizing patterns and behaviors of high-dimensional data.
On one hand we make use of algebraic knowledge and on the other hand we rely on heavy algorithmic machinery.
It seems cumbersome to calculate persistent homology on first glance but thanks to Edelsbrunner, Zomorodian and Carlsson we got a strong algorithm for this purpose.
