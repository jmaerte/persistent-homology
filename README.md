### Build

This Project partially depends on Processing and PeasyCam.
Therefore if you want to build this project I advice you to import it in the IDE of your choice and include the following libraries into your build path.

- [Processing](https://processing.org/):

  - core.jar
  - gluegen-rt.jar
  - jogl-all.jar

- [PeasyCam](http://mrfeinberg.com/peasycam/):

  - peasy-math.jar
  - peasycam.jar

  

If you just want to use it, you can download the repository as zip file on the [project page](https://jmaerte.github.io/persistent-homology/).

### Output
As stated above the output is sometimes rendered using Processing and PeasyCam. In the other cases the program produces R code that can be executed using the ggplot2-package.
